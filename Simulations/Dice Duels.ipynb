    "Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "You're analyzing a new casino game for a quantitative hedge fund that's considering investing in gaming companies. The game is called \"Dice Duels\":\n",
    "- Two players each roll a 20-sided die (values 1-20)\n",
    "- Player A wins if their roll is at least 3 higher than Player B's roll\n",
    "- Player B wins if their roll is at least 2 higher than Player A's roll\n",
    "- If neither condition is met, it's a tie and they re-roll\n",
    "- The game continues until there's a winner\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Monte Carlo simulation to determine:\n",
    "1. The fair odds the casino should offer\n",
    "2. The house edge (casino's expected profit percentage)\n",
    "3. The risk of ruin (probability casino loses > $10,000 in 10,000 bets)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume:\n",
    "- Players bet $100 each on themselves\n",
    "- Casino takes 5% commission on the winner's profit\n",
    "- Players are equally skilled (fair dice)"
